        <h2>On the half-life of conviction</h2>
        <p>
          Most strong opinions have a shorter shelf life than we admit. The interesting
          practice is not holding convictions, but noticing the moment they start to
          decay &mdash; and deciding whether to reinforce or release them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The founders who navigate this well tend to update fast on evidence
          but slow on identity. They change what they think without changing
          who they are.

        <h2>Density as a product</h2>
        <p>
          The most valuable thing a community can produce is not content or connections
          but density &mdash; the compression of relevant people and ideas into a small
          enough space that collisions become inevitable. Everything else is a side effect
          of getting the density right.

        <h2>Selection vs. curation</h2>
        <p>
          Selection is about filtering. Curation is about sequencing. A good dinner party
          isn't just the right people &mdash; it's the right people in the right order
          of introduction. Most community builders optimize for the guest list when
          they should optimize for the choreography.

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          A place to collect loose threads, working hypotheses, and the occasional
          fully-formed thought. Nothing here is final. Most of it is probably wrong.
          That's the point.
